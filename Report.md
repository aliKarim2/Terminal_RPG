# Unsolved Problems
### Not able to use openChest() function for droploot from a boss or enemy
- The problem appears when I modify the chest in the function (taking items from the chest)
- After I modify it, the function closes and returns to the newGame() function, which is fine, but then the program crashes when I exit the else statement I started in.
- When I open the droploot but dont take anything and just leave, everything is fine
